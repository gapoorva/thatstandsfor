# That Stands For

Finally! A useful Slack integration that will tell you what those pesky acronyms mean! 

Disclaimer: Not actually intended to return the correct contextual meaning of requested acronyms. This is mostly on purpose.

Setup instructions:

1. Find the settings on your Slack to add a custom slash command. Or just follow this link: [Add a Slash Command](https://my.slack.com/services/new/slash-commands)

2. Enter `/what's` for the command name. (You can actually pick whatever you want but if you make it `what's`, it's a lot more fun.)

3. Set all the options on the next page to what you want. The URL to send requests to is http://www.apoorvagupta.com/thatstandsfor/

4. ~~Mock~~ Help your teammates understand what all these acronyms mean by typing `/what's` in a channel. (or whatever else you set the command name to be).
